          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age and Income</h2>
          <p>"The greater one’s income, the lower one’s likelihood of disease and premature death. Studies show that
            Americans at all income levels are less healthy than those with incomes higher than their own.
             Not only is income (the earnings and other money acquired each year) associated with better health, but wealth
            (net worth and assets) affects health as well...</p>

          <p>To some extent, income and wealth directly support better health because wealthier people can afford
            the resources that protect and improve health. In contrast to many low-income people, they tend to have
            jobs that are more stable and flexible; provide good benefits, like paid leave, health insurance, and worksite
            wellness programs; and have fewer occupational hazards. More affluent people have more disposable
            income and can more easily afford medical care and a healthy lifestyle...</p>

          <p>People with low incomes tend to have more restricted access to medical care, are more likely to be
            uninsured or underinsured, and face greater financial barriers to affording deductibles, copayments..."</p>
