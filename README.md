## Dataset:  data.csv

## Step 1: 
Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.

Include state abbreviations in the circles.

Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

## More Data, More Dynamics
1. Include more demographics and more risk factors. Add more labels in the scatter plot and allow users to decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for the state circles' locations as well as the range of the axes. Bind all of the CSV data to the state circles. 

2. Incorporate d3-tip
Implement D3 graphics tooltip to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers the cursor over the element. Use the d3-tip.js plugin developed by Justin Palmer which is included in the plugin.
